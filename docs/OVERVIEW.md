Below is a high-level design for a fully self-contained “plug-and-play” retrofit kit that turns virtually any display refrigerator into a self-service, auto-checkout vending machine.  It combines computer-vision item tracking with per-shelf weight sensing and a friction-free payment/door-unlock flow.

1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW• The kit mounts inside and on top of an existing display fridge.• User scans/authorizes on their phone or via a small NFC/tap reader. Door unlocks.• Overhead cameras + depth sensors watch pick/return events.• Under-shelf/load-cell arrays confirm weight changes per slot.• Embedded compute fuses vision + weight data, identifies items removed or returned, and triggers automatic payment.
2. KEY HARDWARE COMPONENTSA. Vision & Sensing

   1. RGB-D Cameras (e.g. Intel® RealSense™ D435 or similar)– 2× units: one centered overhead, one angled toward lower shelves– 60°–90° field of view, 60+ FPS at 640×480
   2. High-Resolution Color Camera– 1× 8–12 MP fisheye or wide-angle module for fine object morphology
   3. Shelf Load-Cell Arrays– Per shelf: 4× 10 kg (or 20 kg) load cells + HX711 ADC– Capacity tuned to your heaviest product
   4. Door‐State Sensor
      – Magnetic reed switch or IR break‐beam at jamb

 B. Actuation & Access

1. Electronic Latch/Solenoid– 12 VDC, <1 A pull force, microcontroller-driven
2. NFC/Contactless Payment Terminal
   – EMV-compliant reader (optional touchscreen)
   – Alternative: QR-code scanner + mobile app integration

 C. Compute & Connectivity

1. Embedded AI Platform (e.g. NVIDIA® Jetson Xavier NX or TX2)– USB3 ports for cameras, I²C/SPI for weight ADCs– 4 GB+ RAM, 16 GB+ eMMC
2. Network– Wi-Fi 802.11 ac + optional LTE/5G modem– Ethernet pass-through if fridge already has wired LAN
3. Power Supply– Single 12 VDC input (powered from fridge’s existing switch-mode supply or an inline adapter)– UPS-backup capacitor for safe-shutdown
4. MECHANICAL RETROFIT• Camera mounts: low-profile ABS/PC brackets that bolt to fridge interior top.• Shelf sensor plates: thin aluminum plate under existing glass shelves, accommodating load cells at four corners; no drilling into glass.• Latch assembly: replaces or augments door handle with an inline electric strike inside handle housing.• Cable management: adhesive-backed channels and grommets for clean routing.
5. SOFTWARE ARCHITECTUREA. Computer Vision Pipeline

   1. Object Detection & Classification– Pre-trained CNN (e.g. YOLOv5/YOLOX) fine-tuned on your SKU images
   2. Instance Tracking & Event Detection– Track each hand-object interaction through depth-RGB fusion– Identify pick, return, and sliding movements
   3. 3D Localization
      – Map detections into shelf zones via calibrated camera parameters

 B. Weight Sensor Fusion

1. Real-time shelf weight delta monitoring (±5 g resolution)
2. Correlate each vision pick/return event with matching weight change for redundancy
3. Discrepancy alarms if vision≈“remove” but Δweight doesn’t match

 C. Transaction Engine

1. User authentication session established at unlock
2. Items removed are added to a “cart,” items returned are removed
3. On door-close, final cart is totaled and auto-charged via Payment API
4. Digital receipt emailed or pushed to app

 D. Remote Management   • OTA updates for vision models, calibration data, payment firmware   • Cloud dashboard: health, inventory by weight, exception logs, CCTV snapshots on anomalies

5. USER FLOW
6. User taps phone or card at reader → Authenticated (pre-paid deposit or post-pay account).
7. Latch releases; user opens door.
8. System (vision + scales) watches “pick” events; live cart displayed on user’s phone/app.
9. User closes door → system auto-totals and charges.
10. Transaction done, door remains locked until next auth.
11. FAIL-SAFE & SECURITY
    • Encrypted storage and TLS for all communications.
    • Hardware watchdog to lock door on compute fault.
    • Tamper sensors on camera brackets & electronics enclosure.
    • Real-time alerting of mismatches, repeated “panic” removals, or power loss.
